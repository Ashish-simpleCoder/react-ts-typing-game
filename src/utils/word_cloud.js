    'Java is a pure Object-Oriented Programming language. Java is strongly  associated with the Internet because of the fact that the first application program written in Java was HotJava, a web browser to run applets on Internet. Java was meant to be used in distributed environments such as Internet. Every variable in java has a data type. Data types specify the size and type of values that can be stored. Java language is rich in its data types. Loops performs a set of operations repeatedly until the control vairable fails to satisfy the test condition.',

    'JavaScript is a lightweight compiled programming language with first-class functions. Most things are objects in JavaScript. When you create a string, your variable becomes a string object instance, and as a result has a large number of properties and methods available to it. Array objects can be stored in variables and dealt with in much the same way as any other type of value, the difference being that we can access each value inside the list individually, and do super useful and efficient things with the list, like loop through it and do the same thing to every value.',

    'Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages. Rust has rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time. Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.',
